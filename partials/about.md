I'm Xavier Damman. I'm an engineer in computer science and an entrepreneur. I'm passionate about the digital renaissance. I like to think about the future of media (I cofounded [Storify](http://storify.com)), organizations and democracy (I'm now working on [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com). In my spare time, I like to [hack](http://github.com/xdamman) and to [talk](/interviews).
You can follow me on Twitter @xdamman.
