## Playing the long game

Our goal with [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com) is to build a global infrastructure on top of which anyone can start an association anywhere in the world as easily as creating a Facebook group. To achieve that, we are building a network of host organizations that will act as an abstraction layer between the complexity of the pre-digital world, and the new bottom up economy of the 21st century. One single interface to start your association, collect and disburse money transparently (read more: [A New Form of Association for the Internet Generation](https://medium.com/open-collective/a-new-form-of-association-for-the-internet-generation-part-2-fe6d8415f444#.8c049o2w4)).

This won’t happen overnight. It will take time. To reflect that, we, the founders, are committing to a 10 year vesting, instead of the usual 4 years.

There is something to be said about setting the right expectation from the beginning. When you start a 4-month journey, you start getting tired after 3 and a half months. Whereas if you’d have started a 12-month journey, you’d only feel tired at month 11. That’s a bit what happened with my previous company [Storify](https://Storify.com). 4 years in (the regular vesting schedule), it felt like the end of the journey. I was tired. Selling felt like the right thing to do. But the reality is that every single big company had their very tough moments and with only a few exceptions it took them more than 4 years to really become big and significant.

That’s why we agreed to ditch the classic 4-year vesting and take instead a 10-year vesting for [the 3 founders](https://medium.com/open-collective/pia-mancini-and-aseem-sood-join-opencollective-as-cofounders-2d4549bd46fd#.cmg1baw9h). It sets the right expectation for ourselves, our team, our investors and our users. We are in this for the long run. We aren’t going to make short-term decisions that trade off long-term benefits.

Our goal is to enable you to build meaningful associations that will have a lasting impact. We need to rethink the NGOs, unions, political parties and other institutions for our generation. If that’s your goal as well, [please reach out](https://opencollective.com/#signup). We will go out of our way to help you collect the funds to sustain your collective. [This is why we do what we do](https://opencollective.com/faq#wdydwyd). We can do great things together, and we will.

We can’t wait to share this journey with you.
